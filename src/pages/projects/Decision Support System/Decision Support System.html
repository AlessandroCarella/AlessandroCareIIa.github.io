<p>
    For this class project me and my colleagues developed an end-to-end business
    intelligence solution analyzing Chicago traffic crash data to support a mock
    insurance company decision-making through dimensional modeling, ETL
    pipelines, OLAP cubes, and interactive Power BI dashboards.
</p>
<p>
    The complete project is available on GitHub at
    <a href="https://github.com/SaraHoxha/lds-dw-modelling">lds-dw-modelling</a
    >. Collaborating with my colleagues, we divided responsibilities across data
    cleaning, schema design, ETL development, OLAP implementation, and
    dashboards creation. The classes tought me the complete data warehousing
    lifecycle from raw data to actionable business insights and I and my
    colleagues applied those concepts in the project.

<h2>What I Learned</h2>
<p>
    This project was my first opportunity to apply the comprehensive data
    warehousing and OLAP concepts taught throughout the Decision Support Systems
    course. While the lectures provided the theoretical foundation, implementing
    a complete business intelligence solution from raw data to interactive
    dashboards revealed the practical complexities and trade-offs inherent in
    real-world DSS development.
</p>
<p>
    In class, we learned about dimensional modeling, the distinction between
    fact tables and dimension tables, the principles of star and snowflake
    schemas, and the importance of grain definition. When we designed our fact
    table, these principles came to life. The decision to use a snowflake schema
    rather than a pure star schema wasn't arbitrary, it directly applied the
    course material on normalization trade-offs.
</p>
<p>
    The lectures explained that snowflake schemas reduce redundancy by
    normalizing dimension tables, but at the cost of more complex queries
    requiring additional joins. Our choice to normalize the some dimensions into
    more sub-dimensions perfectly illustrated this trade-off.
</p>
<p>
    The course covered ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes and
    the critical importance of data quality in decision support systems.
    Lectures emphasized the 80/20 rule: <b>80% of a data warehousing project's
    effort goes into data cleaning and ETL, with only 20% on reporting and
    analysis</b>. I initially thought this was an exaggeration, but after spending
    weeks on data preprocessing, transformation, and quality validation, I
    completely understand it now.
</p>
<p>
    The SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services) classes taught us about the
    core transformation components: Lookup, Derived Column, Conditional Split,
    Aggregate, and Sort. In the project we used those tools in a chain to create complex data flows. 
</p>
<p>
    The lectures on data quality dimensions turned out to be very useful when we handled missing values across numerous
    columns in the provided tables. The course taught us to document data quality
    decisions and establish business rules for handling anomalies. 
</p>
<p>
    One aspect we had to figure out beyond the course material was the geocoding
    API integration for recovering missing latitude/longitude values. The
    lectures covered external data enrichment conceptually, but the practical
    challenges of API use required independent problem-solving. 
</p>
<p>
    The OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) lectures introduced us to
    multidimensional data modeling, measure groups, dimensions, hierarchies, and
    the fundamental operations of roll-up, drill-down, slice, and dice. The
    course used the classic sales data warehouse example which provided clear conceptual understanding.
</p>
<p>
    The concept of calculated measures, introduced in class through examples
    like profit margins and year-over-year growth, became much more complex in
    our MDX queries. The course taught
    us the WITH MEMBER syntax and the CURRENTMEMBER function, but applying these
    to compute relative time calculations took significant experimentation.
    Understanding that MDX operates on dimensional contexts rather than
    row-by-row like SQL was essential, but
    internalizing it required writing failing queries, debugging, and gradually
    building intuition about when calculations execute in the MDX evaluation
    pipeline.
</p>
<p>
    The MDX (Multidimensional Expressions) portion of the course introduced the
    basic query structure: SELECT on COLUMNS and ROWS, FROM the cube, WHERE for
    slicing. We learned key functions like TOPCOUNT, Filter, Hierarchize, NON
    EMPTY, and aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, MEDIAN, MAX). However, the course
    examples were relatively straightforward.
</p>
<p>
    The course's final section covered dashboard design principles: identifying
    KPIs, choosing appropriate visualizations, enabling interactivity, and
    designing for different user roles. The lectures emphasized that dashboards
    should answer business questions, not just display data.
</p>
<p>
    The performance optimization required for our 257,925 crash records pushed
    us to learn about indexing strategies, query execution plans, and OLAP cube
    processing optimization. The course mentioned that performance matters, but
    we had to independently research SQL Server index types, understand when to
    use clustered versus non-clustered indexes, and learn about SSAS partition
    strategies for large fact tables. When our initial cube processing took over
    10 minutes, we implemented incremental processing, a technique we found in
    Microsoft documentation rather than course lectures.

<h2>Data Understanding, Cleaning, and Enhancement</h2>
<p>
    We began with three, teacher's provided, CSV files from Chicago's traffic
    crash database extracted from the
    <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org">Chicago Data Portal</a>:
    <tt>People.csv</tt>, <tt>Vehicles.csv</tt>, and <tt>Crashes.csv</tt>.
</p>
<p>
    The People table contained demographic and behavioral information about the
    peoples involved in the crashes. Across 14 columns with missing values,
    incorrect data types, and inconsistent representations we applied nine
    cleaning operations to fill and normalize the content of the file.
</p>
<p>
    The Vehicles table provided info about crash-involved vehicles, including
    unit types, license plates, defects, and temporal information. Enhancements
    to the file focused primarily on consolidating missing and inconsistent
    values.
</p>
<p>
    The Crashes dataset contained spatial, temporal, and severity information,
    several data quality improvements applied. Other than the usual missing data
    handling, Geographic data received significant improvement through geocoding
    API integration, filling most missing <tt>LATITUDE</tt>, <tt>LONGITUDE</tt>,
    and <tt>POINT</tt> values using the available <tt>STREET_NAME</tt> and
    <tt>STREET_NO</tt> fields. On top of that, a <b>new derived feature</b>,
    <tt>DELTA_TIME_CRASH_DATE_POLICE_REPORT_DATE</tt>, was created to quantify
    reporting delays.
</p>

<h2>Snowflake Schema Design for Insurance Analytics</h2>
<p>
    During classes we learned the difference between Star, Snowflake, and Fact
    Constellation (otherwise named Galaxy) Schemas, and we found the Snowflake
    schema to be the best fitting for our mock insurance company's analytical
    needs. This structure reduced data redundancy while allowing efficient
    querying of complex relationships.

<h2>Queries for Business Intelligence</h2>
<p>
    We developed four queries addressing specific insurance company analytical
    needs.

<h2>OLAP Cube Implementation</h2>
<p>
    We designed a multidimensional OLAP cube using SQL Server Analysis Services
    (SSAS) to enable sophisticated analytical queries. The cube stores and
    analyzes Chicago traffic crash data using dimensions for
    <b><tt>Person</tt></b
    >, <b><tt>Crash</tt></b
    >, <b><tt>Vehicle</tt></b
    >, and <b><tt>DateTime</tt></b
    >.
</p>
<h3>Dimension Design with Hierarchies</h3>
<p>
    The <b><tt>Person</tt></b> dimension includes attributes like
    <tt>Person_ID</tt>, <tt>Injury_Classification</tt>,
    <tt>Physical_Condition</tt>, <tt>Age</tt>, <tt>Type</tt>, <tt>Sex</tt>,
    <tt>Driver_Action</tt>, <tt>Driver_Vision</tt>, <tt>Age_Group</tt>,
    <tt>City</tt>, and <tt>State</tt>.
</p>
<p>
    The <b><tt>Crash</tt></b> dimension has a complex structure with
    <tt>Crash_ID</tt>, <tt>Crash_Date_ID</tt>, <tt>Police_Notified_Date_ID</tt>,
    <tt>Crash_Location_ID</tt>, <tt>Crash_Condition_ID</tt>, <tt>Injury_ID</tt>,
    <tt>Primary_Contributory_Cause</tt>, <tt>Secondary_Contributory_Cause</tt>,
    and various location attributes.
</p>
<p>
    The <b><tt>Vehicle</tt></b> dimension contains <tt>Vehicle_ID</tt> and
    <tt>Vehicle_Type</tt>. The <b><tt>DateTime</tt></b> dimension includes
    <tt>Date_Time_ID</tt>, <tt>Day</tt>, <tt>Year</tt>, <tt>Month_Name</tt>, and
    <tt>Time</tt> in 24-hour format.
</p>
<p>
    The <b><tt>DateTime</tt></b> dimension includes a hierarchy: <tt>Year</tt> →
    <tt>Month</tt> → <tt>Day</tt> → <tt>Time</tt>. Following OLAP best
    practices, access to these hierarchical attributes is not directly visible
    to end-users.
</p>
<!--  -->
<h3>Measure Groups</h3>
<p>
    The <b><tt>Damage Reimbursement</tt></b> measure group captures financial
    data including <tt>Cost</tt>, <tt>Damage_Reimbursement_Count</tt>, and
    <tt>Average_Cost</tt>, essential for assessing financial impact. The
    <b><tt>Person</tt></b> measure group provides insights into the number and
    type of individuals involved, including <tt>Person_Count</tt>,
    <tt>Count_of_Person_Type</tt>, and <tt>Fatal_Crashes</tt>.
</p>
<p>
    After building and defining the structure, we processed the data and
    deployed the cube on the OLAP server, enabling MDX queries and analysis
    directly within the cube environment.
</p>
<h2>Advanced MDX Query Development</h2>
<p>
    We developed five MDX queries demonstrating different analytical
    capabilities.

<p>
    The dashboard showcases the distribution of total damage costs by vehicle
    category with interactive filtering capabilities. Two primary filters on the
    left allow users to select specific beats of occurrence and vehicle types
    dynamically. The middle column features a treemap at the top highlighting
    total damage costs for selected vehicle categories, providing a hierarchical
    overview of cost distributions. Below, a bar plot displays the same data
    with beat of occurrence comparison context in a detailed format.
</p>
<p>
    On the right, a map visualization provides spatial insights, focusing on the
    Chicago area by default when all beats are selected. The map dynamically
    updates to reflect chosen beats, allowing exploration of specific regions
    and identification of areas with higher damage cost concentrations. Users
    can manipulate filters to adapt displayed data, enabling nuanced analyses of
    relationships between geographical locations and vehicle-related damage
    costs.

<h3>Streets Dashboard: Mobility and Location Analysis</h3>
<p>
    The dashboard provides insights into cost and damage reimbursement by
    street, helping the insurance company locate and analyze mobility dynamics
    when granting insurance agreements or paying damages. The visualizations
    include total cost metrics, average cost increase by year, count of damage
    reimbursements by street, and a street map showing the top 10 streets with
    highest costs in Chicago. These visualizations together help determine new
    policies for the insurance company by revealing patterns in street-level
    crash costs and frequencies.

<h3>People Dashboard: Demographic and Behavioral Analysis</h3>
<p>
    The People dashboard provides actionable information about crash
    participants for business analysts. At the top left, a pie chart titled
    "Proportion of Crash Participants by Physical Condition" identifies the
    impact of factors such as impairment due to drugs, alcohol, or medical
    conditions, helping understand the role of human factors. The map visualizes
    geographical concentrations of crashes, allowing insurers to identify
    high-risk regions for adjustments.
</p>
<p>
    The bottom left bar chart provides insight into crash costs by age group and
    vision impairments, revealing that younger drivers (under 18) and those with
    specific vision conditions incur higher costs, identifying high-risk
    demographics for targeted pricing. The treemap "Driver Action by Injury
    Breakdown" uncovers how specific driver behaviors (failure to act,
    distracted driving) correlate with injuries, showing potential needs to
    adjust premiums for policyholders exhibiting these patterns.
</p>
<p>
    Central KPIs display Participants in Crashes, Total Damage Cost, Fatal
    Crashes, and Average Damage Cost, providing an immediate overview of claim
    volume and financial exposure crucial for forecasting payments and ensuring
    sufficient reserves.
